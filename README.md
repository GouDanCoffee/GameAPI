# GameAPI [![Build](https://github.com/Josscoder/GameAPI/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Josscoder/GameAPI/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Josscoder/GameAPI.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Josscoder/GameAPI)
A simple API to create games based on game states

My idea to create this API was because of inspiration from [this spigot thread.](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/organizing-your-minigame-code-using-fsmgasm.235786/)
All credits for the idea goes to Minikloon.

The game design this API is based on TheHive Bedrock game design

## What is this?

This is an API to create mini-games in easy steps, to avoid repeating the process every time you make a game and avoid clutter when creating a very large game. This API is designed for large Minecraft Bedrock networks, by this I mean that each map will be a server, to avoid lag.
In short, it is an API for semi-long servers.

## How to use this?

In the next part I will show you a couple of examples, of how to use each method and class.
